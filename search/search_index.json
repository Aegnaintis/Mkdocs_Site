The life of the Hara Mori is usually split into two groups, roaming hoards, or Aghau, and the villages who provide food for the Hoards, called \u017dolo (Jol-o). It is said that long ago two brothers had such enormous hoards at their command that resources began running out. The Brothers agreed that some of their people had to till the land and grow food for the rest of the Hara Mori, who would continue the true path of the Aghau. When the time came though they could not agree on which people should be barred from the proper life of the Hara Mori, each insisting that none of their own people would ever subject themselves to this fate and so a great war ensued. After many years of fighting the brothers agreed to meet in single combat with the victor leading the Aghau and the loser establishing the \u017dolo throughout Ha\u01efar to feed them. Because of this the \u017dolo are often referred to as Hara Barl, the same name as a common horse in their language. Seen as existing for service to the hoards they are taken advantage of in much of Ha\u01efar and most of their crops are given as tribute to the strongest Aghau in the region. Like the Vodnik, the Hara Mori are not united and their division into four regions was imposed by Noa when they were conquered. Although treated as provinces and put under the rule of a Noan Governor the Aghau still operate much as they have in the past and the borders are constantly shifting between the different Warlords. In the centre of Ha\u01efar lies G\u00f6bra (Go-Bra) and here the Hara are the closest to how they would have been in the old times. The Aghau roam and fight each other for territory while each \u017dolo pays tribute to the most powerful Warlord in the area and as long as tributes are paid the Aghau generally leave the \u017dolo alone. This is also the province that has most adapted to the control of Noa and were the first of their kind to submit to her rule. In the forests of Hojra, however, there are plenty of resources and so \u017dolo are less relied on, established more as way points than anything else. Because they are less relied on, the Aghau usually see no harm in pillaging any \u017dolo they come across and so the inhabitants can often have their own militias or army. The Hojra have lithe bodies and are extremely agile in their forests, here more than anywhere else in Ha\u01efar warfare can be a way of life with skirmishes between Aghau, \u017dolo and the isolationist Huldu, who they share a border with, almost an every day occurrence. The abundance in resources means that the numbers of the Hojra are relatively large which also contributes to the aggressiveness they are known for. To the west is D\u00f6lra and the inhabitants of this region are generally the largest of the Hara Mori. They are also the only area to have formal borders, split into four areas again, each region is controlled by an Aghau and while not exactly peaceful these regions are the most stable in all of Ha\u01efar. The four Aghau are known for their different Susori, a coming of age ritual, and while this ritual is common across Ha\u01efar the relative power and size of Hara Mori in other parts of the region are considerably smaller than in D\u00f6lra, whose Aghau are many times the size of the other Aghau in Ha\u01efar. The D\u00f6lra are the only Hara Mori to not consider metal armour cowardly or ineffective and they use their armour to great effect. The Kujrag hunt Catoblepas and make armour from their scaled pelts while the \u010cira-Aru are presented their armour and must stand against a stampede of Yale. Not all the Susori deal with armour though as the Ababug Susori involves attacking a nest of \u010cibug and claiming prizes from these monstrosities , they believe their purpose is to hold back these creatures who feign at intelligence. And the Sarga believe that you must hunt dangerous animals and prove that you are strong without the armour before you may be presented with it. Smallest of the Hara Mori are those living in \u010cagra, a frigid and desolate land in the North western most corner of Crucis. With thick coats and stout bodies the inhabitants of this land became experts at living in balance with natural resources and live an entirely nomadic life with very little conflict between the different Aghau. These days though their land is a a constant battlefield with Noa having set its eyes on their lands as its next conquest and the Coalition of the resistance against Noa having formed in its frozen wastes. Now to be a Hara Mori from this land is almost the same as being in direct opposition to the Republic. Perhaps Paradoxically, the major belief the Hara Mori share is represented in the Tewke. A vast Aghau that enjoys protection from the attack of all others of their kind, the Tewke are the past men and they are obsessed with the collection and recording of history. They believe that the world works in Cycles and that by collecting information on current and past events they can find the common threads to predict the future. Commonly consulted on matters of the Self, Season or lifetime they believe and specialise in different levels of the Cycles that extend from a day cycle to a view of the entire world and past worlds that have existed. Their belief does not specify gods or deities however it is common among the Aghau in particular to Deify great heroes and dedicate victories or achievements to great Mori from the past. The Boring Parts The Hara Mori are a centaur race that commonly only lives to be 30-40 years old but they develop far quicker than any other race as their age of maturation is around 5 years old. With fur covering their entire body, including the humanoid half, and their face is almost a halfway point between human and horse with a nose and mouth that protrude from the main part of the face. Their hair usually extends like the mane of a horse up the back of their torso and over their head. The most common coat colors of Hara Mori are Gray in \u010cagra, Chestnut in Hojra and G\u00f6bra and Bay in D\u00f6lra. Though these are the common coat colours this does not mean that they are the only colours and a wide variety can be seen within these categories and even beyond (really any colour a horse can be). The size of the Hara Mori depends of where in their lands they come from, ranging from around 200cm in \u010cagra to 300cm in D\u00f6lra and around 250cm in Hojra and G\u00f6bra. Unique Roles Member of Aghau Tewke \u010cibug Hunter (Ababug Aghau specific) Common Weapons Many have weapons made out of Horn or antlers acquired during the Susori (Clubs, bows or pick like weapons as well as knives) Most have great proficiency with bows","title":"Hara Mori"},{"location":"races/hara_info/#hara-mori","text":"","title":"Hara Mori"},{"location":"races/hara_info/#background","text":"The Hara Mori are a race of centaurs that are native to Ha\u01efar (pronounced Ha-jar) on the mainland.

Originating in the shifting mountains of Kiksuz the Goblin like Kunerga are the smallest of the races in Crucis by far. In their homelands this size was a benefit to them as food and resources were hard to come by and their small bodies needed less food to keep going. They possess incredible eyes which can pick out the finest of details and see shades and colours that ours cannot and have long and nimble fingers which they can use to craft the most astonishing works. The combination of these two factors has led to their dominating the crafting industries and Kunerga wares are considered the best in Crucis. Much of the history of the Kunerga was lost when they were conquered by the Noan's, who then made slaves of almost their entire race. During this time much of their culture was forbidden by their new masters and what survived were the whispers of those brave enough to keep their culture alive at the risk of their own lives. It was, however, changed over the years and there is little doubt that it only barely resembles its original form. This is not the case everywhere though, as some escaped enslavement by Noa and found a new home in Aknaz which, using their talent for creation, they turned into the trade and crafting centre of Crucis. There are now two main groups of Kunerga, those that are free are often found in Aknaz and the Ko, those that are still enslaved, can be found throughout Crucis waiting on their masters. To these masters, the Ko are nothing but property to be owned, used and discarded of when they can no longer work. Some lucky few have earned their freedom from generous masters but with their freedom they lose their safety and it is not uncommon for a recently freed Ko to find themselves kidnapped and sold back into the slavery they had just escaped. Because of this many Ko who gain freedom seek out any wealthy and protected Kunerga or attempt to book passage to Aknaz where they will not have to face the prospect of being owned. The physical weakness of the Kunerga has worked in the favour of the Hulthaz, a mysterious network of spies and assassins who seem to have eyes and ears everywhere. Usually hiding behind a fa\u00e7ade of meek slavery, on the few occasions they have acted overtly they have shaken Crucis and in particular the Noan Republic. Now they are talked about in many places but mostly in rumours and hearsay. The true sign of someone who has dealt with them is often the uncovering of their body after their use has expired. Among the free Kunerga in Aknaz another type of organisation grew, a loose alliance of merchants and the wealthy who use their money and influence to shape Crucis to their desires. The Gulthanan was originally a council of the richest free Kunerga who met to discuss issues they all faced, namely the impending threat of Noa. In Modern times however it has grown substantially and many wealthy merchants brag about being among their numbers though more commonly they have the patronage of a true member of the inner council. Their bribes and influence are so prolific that they have even dictated the course of Noa's mighty Republic at times and many among their council have Senators, Legates and at other times Consuls under their thumb. The Boring Bits The Kunerga are a small Goblin like race that are largely humanoid with arms that hang down past their waist and long fingers. Their skin is a light grey green colour and they have large bulbous heads, usually without any hair. They have exceptional hearing from their large ears which are long and come to a sharp point at the back, some have fan like flaps that hang down off these ears as well. The Vision of a Kunerga is excellent and they can see shades and colours that no other race on Crucis can. Their eyes are usually either Black, Red or Orange and are large in their heads as well. The average height for a Kunerga is ~120cm for both sexes which makes them the smallest of the races by far. Due to the environment that the Kunerga originated in they evolved to need far less food and water than any other race and so can survive quite easily off of very little sustenance.

Despite being larger than their Baal enemies the Cyclopean Luamis, then called the Manok, were beaten back after their initial success and because their invasion ended in the sacking of Noa their fate was the worst of all the races that Noa has conquered. In an act that still haunts the Luamis to this day the Noans hunted down almost all their adults and executed them, this was to more effectively do what they had attempted to do with the Kunerga. Rob them of their past and raise them as slaves whose culture is subservience. With the Luamis as a slave race the Noan's had a powerful addition to their armies and they have used this advantage in many of their battles to date. Many Luamis are still slaves and are used for manual labour or as manpower for the legions. They are born in Breeding houses and almost immediately a life is chosen for them. Those that become domestic slaves are often treated as nothing more than beasts of burden with the strength that their race is known for being exploited for the benefit of their Noan masters. The rest go to the legions and are trained to fight and die for the Republic. For these, at least, there is glory to be attained and their comrades become the family that is denied others of their race.

The Luamis are born as twins and this is at once their greatest strength and also their greatest weakness. From the little that has survived from the Noans attempt to purge their history it can be seen that in the past the intense familial bonds that exists among the Luamis, particularly with their twin or Diosk, had lead to long held grudges and in fighting that had come close to bringing their race to extinction. Stories like these are the often allowed by Noa to highlight the need that the Luamis have for the Noan's, that their continued existence depends on the destruction of these filial ties. Now the Luamis are separated from their Diosk at birth but many still find each other later in life. Once their bond is re-established the pair can be an incredible force but the nature of their connection is so intense that to even be separated from each other for a time can cause anguish and at times even be physically painful.

Once a generation there is born a Luamis who has no twin and has two pupils in their single eye. Throughout their history these H\u00f3los have been instruments of change for their race and they are believed to be the perfect form of their kind, two halves making a whole. One such H\u00f3los was the creator of a group known as the Acantha, the thorn. Originally trying simply to reunite Luamis with their Diosk Anicetus eventually led a small revolution against Noa and was responsible for smuggling many Luamis away from their masters to live in the shifting mountains of Kiksuz with others of their kind and, hopefully, their Diosk. Gryphus, as he was known among the liberated, was eventually discovered and it is believed that the Acantha was wiped out, though whispers still speak of them and every Luamis dreams of Gryphus coming to liberate them.

Despite being larger than their Baal enemies the Cyclopean Luamis, then called the Manok, were beaten back after their initial success and because their invasion ended in the sacking of Noa their fate was the worst of all the races that Noa has conquered. In an act that still haunts the Luamis to this day the Noans hunted down almost all their adults and executed them, this was to more effectively do what they had attempted to do with the Kunerga. Rob them of their past and raise them as slaves whose culture is subservience. With the Luamis as a slave race the Noan's had a powerful addition to their armies and they have used this advantage in many of their battles to date. Many Luamis are still slaves and are used for manual labour or as manpower for the legions. They are born in Breeding houses and almost immediately a life is chosen for them. Those that become domestic slaves are often treated as nothing more than beasts of burden with the strength that their race is known for being exploited for the benefit of their Noan masters.

Called Waika Laia, these pools are where Vod lay their eggs and leave them to grow to infancy. Each pool usually nurtures the eggs of many surrounding villages and so throughout their history tribes have sought control of these vital locations. With this control comes the power to dictate how many offspring the surrounding tribes can have, if any, and so control the population of any who dare oppose them. Out of the tyranny that this brought about a religious order was born that now maintains many of the Waika Laia throughout Aruna Rohe. The Hok Anago, as they are called now, developed ways of purifying the pools and even found ways of making previously poisoned or barren pools capable of nurturing the eggs of Vod. This knowledge is what allowed the Vod long ago to leave their ancestral home of Lakey Aina, colonising the whole of Aruna Rohe and taking the beliefs, and representatives, of the Hok with them. In those days the Hok were a powerful and structured religious order that were tasked with the care, defence and control of almost all the Waika Laia that had been established by the Vod. As the years passed, the Hok's presence across all of Aruna Rohe as well as the inherent ability of their beliefs to vary greatly from one place to the next lead to huge differences in worship. The heavily structured nature it once had was lost over the vast distances it now occupied. In some areas, like Kake and much of Lakey Aina, the Hok have retained the power and systems that they had developed so long ago. While in others their role lost its religious component to became caretakers and defenders of the Waika Laia only. In still others they have lost many of the practical aspects of their role to become a mostly symbolic spiritual guide. While the order of the Hok Anago may have lost much of its power, the beliefs they carried with them are still the dominant form of spiritualism for all Vod. It is easy to miss this fact, however, as their belief is a complex one. Ultimately they believe in Katomea, the World God who consumes itself to stay alive, but use of that name is quite uncommon in their worship. They believe that Katomea created the world from its own body and everything that is in the world is a part of it. Counted among the inhabitants of their world are many Demi-gods and Spirits, powerful beings that came from Katomea long ago and can influence or even control aspects of the world, like the weather or the oceans. These are the Gods that are commonly worshipped and they are as numerous as their worshippers, with every island and Waika Laia having its own collection of protectors and destroyers. Beyond anything else the Vod are a practical people and whether this has been due to their religious beliefs, which unlike many other cultures does not involve sacrifices to the Gods, or if their religion mirrored their culture is unknown. The best examples of this practicality can be seen in the Matu'Opili, a mating festival that usually takes place every three years, and the Kanak Maa, their coming of age trial. The Matu'Opili is perhaps the most ritualistic event that the Vod take part in and is when the next generation of eggs are laid. To an observer it could seem to be very ceremonial with the chosen males all joining in song while the females demonstrate their martial prowess in concert with the melodies created by the men. But almost every facet, from those chosen, to the demonstrations themselves, has a heavy element of practicality. The chosen pairs are often picked because their strengths are what the tribe desires in the next generation. While the displays, if impressive enough, can grant a village more space in the Waika Laia for their eggs, providing them with better standing. The other major ritual of the Vod is the Kanak Maa, an often dangerous trial designed to prove a child is ready to become an adult of the tribe. Depending on the region a Vod is from this could range from slaying a fearsome creature of the sea or land to a race to collect some treasure or item from the den of a dangerous animal. In many of the forms of the trail it is conducted in female and male pairs and the focus is on the preparation and planning of the task as well as understanding the abilities and limits of both participants. In Lakey Aina, for example, the trial is commonly a hunt where the male will build a Maga Komu, a small two person boat often used by the Vod, and then the pair will go out into the ocean where the female will hunt a creature of the sea. Once killed the pair will then bring it back to the tribe for a feast to celebrate their completion and step into adulthood. However, if the pair bring back a creature and are severely inured they are considered to have performed poorly in the trial no matter how large or fierce the creature was. This is seen as a sign of not understanding their own limits and lacking and understanding that a dead Vod cannot contribute to the tribe in any way. Almost all Vod can essentially breath underwater through their skin, however this ability has a drawback as toxins can easily be introduced to their blood stream just by contact. They also have the ability to breath without the use of their lungs and so can continue a fight long after others would fall. Even the worst swimmers of the Vod still far exceed those of any other race and their lifestyles are often partially aquatic. This has made them reliant on water as the mucus they produce to protect their skin from taking in dirt and other contaminants is secreted constantly and uses a lot of water. This means that any Vod must pay particular attention to their hydration. The Boring Bits Of all the races, the Vod are the most varied in appearance and while they generally share the same shape the abilities, colour and size of a Vod will change depending on which of the five regions of Aruna Rohe they are from. It is important to note that while maps will often show this division it was put in place by the Noan Republic when they conquered the region. With the exception of the Kake, the other regions are not and have never been united formally and two tribes living in a province will not necessarily be at peace or allied. This division was one of the main reasons why the Noans found success in their Conquest of Aruna Rohe. Lakey Aina Those from the province of Lakey Aina are generally dark green on their backs and the tops of their head and have white streaks or dots across their backs. They also have golden eyes with horizontal slits for pupils. Other than their equals the Kake they are the best swimmers in all Crucis and very like the Kake they live much of their lives in the water, cultivating their Algae and seaweed farms as well as fishing and hunting in the depths of the ocean. The Aina see themselves as the true Vod and the progenitors of the rest of the race as it is generally agreed that their race began its life on the islands they inhabit and spread across all of Aruna Rohe. This general attitude has often kept their tribes apart from those in the other provinces and has made them suspicious of those that do not look the same as they them. The Plat To the north and west of Lakey Aina are the two islands that make up Plat Mea. The Plat are the most physically different among the Vod and are the generally the largest of the Vod, they are primarily land dwellers and so their swimming ability is quite basic compared to other Vod, they are still better swimmers than most from the other races however. The Plat are a a brown or Tan colour with rough skin and their eyes are either black or grey with round pupils, they have large glands on their necks which secrete toxins, a hallucinogenic on the south island and a poison on the north island. These toxins have no effect on the Plat whose bodies have adapted to the toxins their bodies produce but are enough to hamper those from other races who come into contact with them. Over the years the Plat have discovered many clever uses for these secretions and those that work with these substances are called the Luruga making medicines, poisons and drugs in equal measure and to the specifications required. Plat also have bone protrusions coming out of their feet called the Iriloika. Many worriers undergo a painful process to sharpen these protrusions into Irilau and in a fight these hidden blades can be very effective, especially if combined with the toxins the Plat produce. Kake The only officially united province in the history of Aruna Rohe was the once great Kake empire. Its luscious and rich landscape made the tribes who called it home a target of the surrounding islands and so they banded together long ago into a nation. Believing themselves to be the perfect iteration of the Vod they saw the actions of those outside their borders as beneath them. This belief led them to a strange doctrine of violence in defence only which seemed to be very in line with the old traditions of the Hok Anago who indeed had the strongest and most structured presence here than anywhere else. Due to their abundant resources their population could grow freely and with this population growth came a more brutal way of life. Their Kanak Maa for instance directly pits the young against each other and those that survive are accepted as adults in the tribe. They were seen as extreme by the surrounding regions who did not often understand that their raids and piracy were what had caused this attitude. Now though their lands have been given to the surrounding tribes and their empire has lost its once formidable power. The Kake are most similar in appearance to the Aina and are excellent swimmers and sailors who spend much of their time underwater and their Milky or light blue colouring helps them immensely in the water as it can act as a camouflage which combined with their prowess underwater is used to their great advantage. It is wise to assume if you are trespassing in their waters that their patrols could pop up at any moment and the last thing you will see are patterned gold eyes in the water. Maha Pohaku To the South West of Kake is Maha Pohaku, a set of islands that was the first Vod Province to be conquered by the Noans. The hills and canyons that characterise this area made those that call it home into a strong and fierce group who have always had to fight to get what they need and be able to protect it once they had. Often seen as pirates they have difficult relations with many of the surrounding tribes and areas who they raid for resources. This raiding is what originally drew the attention of the Noan Republic and many Vod blame the tribes in that area for bring the the Noan's to their islands. While the Noan's would have inevitably attempted to conquer Aruna Rohe it was the ferocity of the Maha who beat them back more times than any other group has that ensured that the Vod did not suffer the same fate as the Kobold or the Luamis and were treated with respect rather than subjugation after they were conquered. The Maha The Maha are often white or grey with black markings on their backs and grey eyes and Diamond shaped pupils. They have powerful legs and take huge leaps when needed. A common battle tactic of the tribes in this region is jumping right before engaging to get behind an enemy or using the power for a burst of speed that can be hard to control. Timu Finally are the the most mysterious group among the Vod. Living largely on the island of Timu are many tribes whose abilities and colour follow no common thread other than they are undeniably Vod. Hidden in the rainforests on the island their culture and beliefs are largely a mystery though among the tribes that conduct trade with regions outside of Ulu Timu they seem to have a similar structure to other Vod in Aruna Rohe. Generally characterised by brighter coloured skin they usually identified by their lack of resemblance to any other group of Vod or possessing vastly different abilities than their cousins to the east. Of the many mutations that have been witnessed, many posses sticky nodes on their fingers and toes. Some have been seen to have almost transparent bodies, extra webbing on their toes and fingers that can be used to glide and poisonous mucus that are quite potent to touch.

A world similar to our own in landscape but little else. Split into 6 large territories these lands provide opportunity and tragedy in equal parts. To the South East lies Contis, seat of the mighty Noan Republic whose power extends over most of the known world. Their lands are rife with political intrigue and as the centre of the largest power in the world many forces are at play within its borders. Baal Senators and Provincial governors plot and scheme to gain rank and favour to increase their power and influence over each other and the other races. Among the subservient Ko an organisation known as the Hulthaz trades in secrets and death and seeks to cause harm to the Baal for enslaving most of their race. Hidden in the shifting mountains of Kiksuz which straddle the centre of the continent lies the Acantha, Luamis who have escaped their slavery to live a life free from the rule of the Republic. On top of all this are some among the Baal who wish to rule themselves once more as they did before Noa came with its armies and forced them into submission. To the west of Contis lies Aknaz, home of the Free Kunerga and the commerce and trade centre of the world. Only the best goods come from these islands and its said that its markets are so packed with stalls and shop fronts that they dwarf even great Noa herself. Among their merchants, and with trade routes and connections across the whole of Crucis, is the Gulthanan. A syndicate of wealthy merchants whose goal is to exploit any opportunity to make themselves richer and more powerful. \u201cAnywhere there is profit you will find the Gulthanan and where ever they appear, profit will soon follow\u201d is a common saying in Crucis. Their strength lies in the looseness of their ties and often times prominent members will be actively working against each other rather than together. Their protection of the Aknaz region and their alleged role in a multitude of assassinations of high ranking and prominent Noans long ago, now called the Night of Knives, has made Noa wary of them and were their bribes not so prolific they would have been destroyed long ago. On the mainland the Campaigning legions have suffered huge loses after several rebellious factions have coalesced to form a united front in defiance of the Republic. Their numbers include Noan trained legions of Baal and Luamis who defected, agents of the Hulthaz who supply them with information and it is rumoured that members of the Gulthanan are funding their efforts and selling them provisions and arms. Most concerning of all is the help they have garnered from the mysterious Errolan, Giants from the canyons of Yaga-Ruun, to the north, whose lands no Noan army has ever set foot in, despite the numbers they have thrown against it. This rebellion has weakened Noa in the eyes of those who live under its rule and sparked many to fight for their freedom from its dominion. Throughout Ha\u01efar the roaming Aghau of the Hara Mori are causing trouble and waylaying any who they come across and to the east the D\u00f6lra have begun retaking their lands from Noa. To the far west the Giggling priests of the isolationist Huldu still attack any who come close to their borders driving them insane with the potency of their chemicals and the maniacal laughter that follows them wherever they go. In Aruna Rohe, the ancestral home of the Vodnik, many of the tribes have taken the emergence of the Coalition as an opportunity to claim their lands back from Noa and the marginalised Kake have organised to bring their once powerful kingdom back to its former glory while many of the tribes in Maha Pohaku and Ulu Timu are taking any chance they can to plunder and raid to gather as much resources as they can before Noa regains control. This is the state of the world you are now in friends. The path you take is your own but chose your actions wisely as there are many forces at work in Crucis and who knows what outcome your actions will have.","title":"Crucis"},{"location":"worlds/crucis_info/#crucis","text":"","title":"Crucis"},{"location":"worlds/crucis_info/#background","text":"Welcome, friends, to Crucis.
