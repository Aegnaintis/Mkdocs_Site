<h1 id="baal">Baal</h1>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>In <em>Crucis</em> the Minotaur race of the Baal has become almost synonymous with the Noan Republic and while most of their kingdoms are part of the Republic they are not all considered Noan Citizens. It is this distinction that causes many to chafe under its rule and wish for a return of the time they ruled themselves. Many attempt to accomplish this within the confines of the Republic but historically, when Noa has been perceived to be weak, dissenters have sought to shake off the chains of their rulers and claim their country for themselves. Precious few of these rebellions have lasted long though and the retribution of Noa comes upon the ever marching heels of her legions.</p>
<p>In the south of Contis lies Noa itself, the beating heart of the Republic. From this place campaigning legions have come forth for hundreds of years to claim lands and peoples as their own. Their relentlessness and brutality has been such that they have swept through most of the known world, expanding Noa's borders over the broken spirits of their enemies. Only the mighty Errolan, the silent giants of the North, have managed to halt their march, but their canyons are the only lands truly free from Noa.</p>
<p>While the legions of the mainland campaign to secure more territory to add to their collection, Noa and its surrounding regions are a hotbed of politics and scheming. As the Senators bicker and play political games amongst themselves the lives of others can be forever changed. Those that are unfortunate enough to be caught up in their machinations have no way of knowing whether their involvement will gain them riches and glory or ruin and death. The manoeuvres of the Senators aren't the only ones to be wary of, though, as many of the wealthy patricians have their own stratagems in motion. Often using the plebeian and slave classes as expendable pawns they seek to further their own position and care little for those they exploit. The record of their collateral damage is a long list of lives that have been destroyed to fuel their greed and ambition.</p>
<p>To the north of Dualis are the Timulan, city-states of Baal that long ago bent the knee to Noa and her endless legions. These once independent kingdoms now fall under the Republics rule though the degree of resistance their ancestors used determined the relative freedom they have within its systems. Some lavish from their relationship with Noa and are largely autonomous while others have been brought low by the harsh laws and taxes forced upon them. These are not the least fortunate, however, as some transgressed against Noa too many times and have been wiped out completely. Their people slaughtered or enslaved and their lands given to whichever Noan had the love of the Senate, their story is the warning that Noa uses to dissuade rebellion.</p>
<p>Despite this though, the many provinces that make up Timula are considered to be the cultural hub of the Republic and any lover of the arts has their eyes on the many theatres and forums of their Cities. Over the years Noan opinion has gone from scorn to appreciation of these talents and some see the Timulans as the greatest innovators and creators among the Baal while others still look at their pursuits as frivolous endeavours and monuments to vanity.</p>
<h3 id="the-boring-bits">The Boring Bits</h3>
<p>The Baal are a race of Minotaur who stand on cloven hooves and are covered in fur that varies from Black and White to Brown or even Red. The Baal also have Bovine like faces and some have Horns atop their heads. Males are the taller of the sexes and average height for men is ~180 cm not including horns while Women average ~165cm.</p>
<h4 id="timula">Timula</h4>
<p>In Timula to the north their Fur is usually longer and Brown with occasional Red colouring and most Timulans do not have horns on their head. Their fur is rarely patterned like their southern cousins and they are often slightly larger as well. The many provinces of Timula are seen as the cultural centre of the Republic and so many Baal raised in those regions are quite versed in the arts, music and drama</p>
<h4 id="dualians">Dualians</h4>
<p>The Dualians are usually some combination of Black and White and their patterns vary greatly. They also have horns on their heads that if left on their own curve slightly up but many have taken to training the growth of their horns into whatever shape pleases them or trimming them entirely depending on the fashion of the place and time. As the Militaristic and Political capital many who are raised here are well versed in combat or speechcraft.</p>
<h3 id="unique-roles">Unique Roles</h3>
<ul>
<li>Priest/Priestess of one of their Gods</li>
<li>Senators and Nobles</li>
<li>All state appointed roles like governors and officers of the Judiciary</li>
<li>Ranking members of the Legions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-weapons">Common Weapons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Legions prefer short swords, javelins and spears</li>
<li>Any medieval tier weapon</li>
